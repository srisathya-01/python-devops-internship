# Python DevOps Internship Project 🚀

**Production-grade Python DevOps demonstration** for VR Della internship showcasing CI/CD, multi-environment deployments, branch protection, and automated rollback procedures.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

- ✅ **Protected main branch** (PR-only workflow enforced)
- ✅ **Staging & Production environments** separation  
- ✅ **Deployment automation** scripts (staging/production)
- ✅ **Rollback procedures** tested and documented
- ✅ **Enterprise GitOps practices** (branch protection, PR workflow)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the protected repo
git clone https://github.com/srisathya-01/python-devops-internship.git
cd python-devops-internship

# 2. Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Deploy to staging (follows GitOps workflow)
bash ci-cd/deploy-staging.sh

# 4. Test rollback procedure
bash ci-cd/rollback.sh

💼 Internship Deliverables Demonstrated
GitOps Workflow: develop → PR → main (protected)

Multi-Environment Strategy: staging/production separation

Deployment Automation: Manual scripts → GitHub Actions (next)

Rollback Procedures: Tested end-to-end

Infrastructure as Code: Environment configs versioned

🤝 Contribution Workflow (ENFORCED)
